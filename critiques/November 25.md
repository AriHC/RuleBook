## Syntax
I would definitely recommend having a tutorial or guide for the syntax here.
Does the order matter for the commands (Players, Board, etc.)? If it's possible
to have the order not matter, that would be better in my opinion. Other than that,
I like the syntax. 

Win and tie conditions are definitely important for the full program, so I agree
with prioritizing that.
