## Syntax
I really like the syntax so far. How will you teach people what keywords are used?
I like how you are specifying the pieces and their characters. I think that will make
displaying your final game much easier and isn't too burdensome for the user. 

I agree that it would probably be a good idea to use curly braces to specify blocks
instead of colons. I'm also not sure how possible it will be to parse your intended
syntax. I would recommend trying to set the parser earlier than later, even if you 
haven't completely defined the IR, so you can figure out if it is possible or not.

I would probably try to simplify the way you specify legal moves. I feel it would get
very difficult to specify what moves are legal for chess with your current syntax. 

For your pseudo-variables, do you want to just essentially past the definition of each 
term wherever the term is? That could be possible, but may get messy.
