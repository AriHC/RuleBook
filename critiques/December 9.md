# Critique

## README

Your README looks really good! I like the links to the SBT download (I think
I'll be stealing that idea). 

## Tic-tac-toe and Connect-four

After playing through, it looks really good. 
Tic-tac-toe is very intuitive. Connect-four is a bit confusing with requiring
the user to input both row and column and only using the column. Would there
be a possibility of just providing a single value? How hard would that be to
add? That would be my only change for the actual usability.

The actual code to implement Tic-tac-toe and Connect-four is very readable.
I would definitely recommend that you add that cheat sheet you were talking
about.

## Summary

Overall, the only suggestion I have would be to allow single value inputs
when you are only using the column, if that is possible.
