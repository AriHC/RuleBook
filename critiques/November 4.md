# Critique for November 4

I like that you are currently limiting your scope to grid based games. I would probably start
with checkers rather than chess, as a single type of piece may be easier. A reasonable progression
may be tic-tac-toe, checkers, then chess if you have extra time. Limiting the games to one type
of piece would limit the scope to a place that would be a more reasonable place to start. 

I would be curious about your visual representation of the board. How would you plan to have the
rule author define the reprsentation of each piece? This would be another place that a single type
of piece, as in tic-tac-toe and checkers may be easier to start. 

####What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?
I think I would like using this, either when learning games or if I came up with an idea for a game. The fairly
easy way in which one could define the rules and pieces for a game and then see how it works out seems like a 
definite improvement over creating a physical game (as you mentioned in your description). I also like the idea
of an appendix at the end in which you define any terms that may be unfamiliar to a new player but unnecessary for
experienced players. 

####What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?
While I think that a good and clear design will cut down on the required engineering in this project, this project
seems like it will be very heavy on the engineering side. I may recommend implementing a more limited command set
initially and expanding it once you have made sure you like it rather than trying to make a flexible command set 
from the start. 

####How can the project maximize the time spent on language design? How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas?
A lot of your design and decision making will be in defining the scope of your project and the balance between
flexibility and easy implementation. By spending extra time in this planning stage, I think your implementation will
be easier. 

####What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?
Again, your challenges will be defining the scope and figuring out how broad your command set will be.
