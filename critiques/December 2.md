# Critique

## Project Notebook

* I still definitely think that a user guide should be a high priority.
* I would recommend getting this done soonish so you can have a few test/update iterations. 
* For the scope of this project, I think it is fair to assume that a turn will be a single move. 
* From reading over your example, the part to be read by the player looks pretty good and English-like. The definitions are fairly verbose, but I'm not sure how you could get around that. 

## Preliminary Evaluation

* I agree that the ability to select exactly, up to, or at least some number of pieces will be very useful. 
* As mentioned above, I think that you've done a pretty good job making the player-used part readable and understandable even if it isn't perfect English. 
* At least some unit tests would be nice. :) 
* I agree that internal would have been easier for the player-readable part, but it would likely have made the developer-side work more difficult. 
* Documentation and testing sounds like a good plan.
