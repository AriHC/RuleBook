* Initialize board, players according to board & players
* Put pieces on board/give to players according to set up
* Starting with player 1, loop:
  * Print current board state
  * No legal moves (probably done in form of bad runtime algorithm that tests all possible moves)? End game as stalemate
    * This may be very difficult and a stretch goal; as defining all possible moves is very hard.
  * Loop:
    * Get move input from player
    * If legal move, break
  * Perform move
  * Check win condition for current player
    * If won, end game and note they won
